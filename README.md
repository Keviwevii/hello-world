# hello-world
Just another repository

Hi Everyone! 

I have experience using git already but I am using this to go through the github guides and expand my knowledge.
I love laughing and having fun with friends and coworkers. I am currently going through a full-stack course on codeacademy and 
I am having a lot of fun so far!
